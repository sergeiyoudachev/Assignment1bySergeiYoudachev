<h2>Overview</h2>
I would like to develop program which will help to get rid of gaming addiction in adults and children. 
Recently, children have been sitting at home and the main communication takes place through games and social 
networks. Sometimes it becomes addictive. How can we distract the user from spending hours on games? After all, 
this time can be spent, for example, on studying history, biology or something else, depending on the age of the person. 
I thin about a program for microlearning which will display the task window on top of the game or social network.
The program will automatically offer to go through a micro lesson on some topic and answer questions. Only 3-5 minutes. 
And only then will be possible to open the game or social network or continue with it. Will be possible to customize 
the appearance of the window of this program and make training pauses in games and when using social networks. 
In addition, the microlearning program will also be managed from the phone, if the parents want to see how the 
program is running on the child's computer.
<h2>Motivation</h2>
“In fact, psychologists estimate that as many as 5 to 10% of Americans meet the criteria 
for social media addiction today….This continuous use eventually leads to multiple interpersonal problems, 
such as ignoring real life relationships, work or school responsibilities, and physical health, which may 
then exacerbate an individual’s undesirable moods”.(https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/social-media-addiction/). 
Gambling addiction also falls into this category and players have a lot of chances to forget about family, work and sports. 
There are cases that excessive passion for social networks leads to profound mental disorders and in some cases to suicide due to cyberbullying in the networks. This project is very interesting to me because this program will help people return to real life through distraction and study of various topics and possibly save someone from the unwanted consequences of addiction.
<h2>Description</h2>
The microlearning program will partially or completely cover the window of a social network or game, and this window 
will display reading material or a short video. After reading or watching the video, a multiple choice test will be offered. 
If the answer is correct, then the micro study program will close and reopen after a certain period of time. The program 
will have settings where will be possible configure the user's age, gender, topics of interest and the interval for the 
appearance of windows with tasks. It will also be possible to customize the list of programs that will be closed by the 
microlearning window. You can cancel the appearance of the program or delete it only after entering the secret code or system 
administrator privileges. Also if the microlearning program is installed on the child's computer, then the parents will 
have the opportunity to control it through the application installed on the smartphone. Through a smartphone it will be 
possible to find out what questions the child was asked, how he answered them and also change the program settings. 
In addition, it will be possible to decrease or increase the 
interval of showing micro lessons if parents deem it necessary to do so. Adults will be able to customize themselves to suit 
their needs. It will be possible to install microlearning on Android and iOS phones with the same functions and settings 
as on a computer. The program database will contain a lot of questions on various topics that will be offered to users. The  filling of the database can be offered to the owners of various courses and private teachers, who will be able to leave referral links to their resources and lessons in the microlearning program window. These can be questions about the study of languages, history, geography, culture and art. If user like the question, he can click on the link of the teacher who offered the micro-lesson and go to his website. Questions will be grouped by age and interest. Micro-lessons will appear in random order, but those lessons that have already appeared will be marked as learned and will no longer be shown for a month.
In addition, user can make it possible to simply break in the game or view the social network for 5-10 minutes with the 
microlearning program window, but without showing the lesson. User can choose to listen to music, a countdown timer screen saver or a slideshow of nature views or other beautiful pictures. Registration in the microlearning program will enable remote control of the program and . The version without registration is simpler and may allow setting the age and interests of the user, the lessons learned will be registered in the local database on the hard disk. In addition to the database on the server, there will be a database on the local disk if there is no internet connection. The micro-lesson database can be updated when connected to the Internet, or you can update it using the downloaded file. The microlearning program in the first priority will access the database via the Internet, and if the Internet connection is not established, then it will access the local database. If the program cannot connect to the databases via the Internet or on a local disk, then a basic splash screen with a 5-10 minute timer will appear on the program window for a break in the game or using a social network.
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
I think that for programming my microlearning program I will use Java to create the program itself and SQL to create the database. To create an application for smartphones on iOS, one of the main languages ​​of iOS development will be used: Objective-C or Swift. The Android application development will be developed in Kotlin, which is an enhanced Java. To work with Java and Kotlin, I will need to install one of the Java coding programs. For example NetBeans, Eclipse or
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. From hardware I need a powerful computer, preferably two screens for comfortable coding. To develop applications for smartphones, I need an Android smartphone and another iOS smartphone.
Skills required
To develop my project, I will need in-depth knowledge of Java and Kotlin programming. I also need knowledge of programming languages ​​for mobile devices. To create and manage a database, I need to know SQL and have advanced knowledge of database programming. In addition to all this, it is necessary to have communication skills and commercial interest, since I will have to negotiate with private teachers and training courses to agree to work with me and provide lessons for the program database. To create a project, I will need common technical devices such as a computer, smartphones and a printer. An internet connection is also required. It will be possible to find skills only by studying programming languages ​​well and everything related to this, I will need a good knowledge of theory and practice. Software and hardware will not be a big problem, since the software can be downloaded from the Internet and the hardware will already be there by the beginning of work on the project.
<h2>Outcome</h2>
The result of the project will be a wonderful microlearning program that will 
give an adult or a child the opportunity to be distracted from games or social networks, 
thereby fighting addiction to it. In addition, my microlearning program will provide an opportunity 
to learn a lot of new and interesting things, and  users could be able to start learning what they want 
and follow referral links of teachers and courses. The problem of addiction will be solve by distracting 
the user from being near the computer for a long time, and also the process of studying something can distract 
the user from the often negative impact of social networks and games. Shifting  thoughts from  useless 
chats to watching micro lessons is one way to avoid addiction. My microlearning program will 
provide an opportunity for the user to acquire new knowledge, it is likely that one of the micro-lessons 
will be able to impress the user and determine the future area of ​​his interests. In addition, informative 
materials and banners from universities, colleges and courses will be placed in the micro-lessons window. 
This can give impetus for future studies and choose the right educational institution.
