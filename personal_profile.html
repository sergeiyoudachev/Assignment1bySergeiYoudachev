                        These results mean for me that I am a diplomatic person who will always compromise to achieve a goal. 
                        Tests show that I am very sensitive and empathic, have a deep sense of idealism and integrity.
                         But there may be a disadvantage that I am an idealist and for the sake of the ideal could work hard,
                          which can upset the work-family balance.<br>
                        I worry about each member of the group and the group itself as a whole.
                         I have a very high work ethic, which means that I always treat my colleagues with great respect
                          and attention. I am very creative and my ideas can be useful for completing projects and tasks.
                           My discernment will be indispensable for understanding the work and completing the task.<br>
                        I think when forming a team I will be able to play an important role in a common cause because of 
                        my attitude towards colleagues, adherence to principles and efficiency. The team must work together,
                         avoid conflict, and constantly tackle difficult challenges. Tests show that I can treat everyone with 
                         respect, come to a common decision and avoid "sharp corners" in teamwork.
