                    Creating conversion-focused pages. I really like this position and I would like to get it because I really

                       to be familiar with browser testing and debugging, have to be knowledgeable of the web development process 
                       (design and deployment).</p>
                       <p>At the moment I know HTML, CSS, I am learning JavaScript and will soon start learning PHP. 
                    I have experience in developing simple internet sites and this experience may come in handy for me. 
                    Also, I'm going to consider working with WordPress and WooCommerce. I think I have the aesthetic taste and analytical 
                    skills required by the employer.</p>
                    <p>My plan for this or a similar position is that I have thought out my study plan at RMIT and that I will develop 
                      skills and study web development programs by myself. After Introduction to Information Technology 
                      I'm going to take Introduction to Programming and User-Centred Design. And after completing these two 
                      courses - Core Subjects Web Programming and Database Concepts. The User-Centred Design course will teach me 
                      how to properly design sites and programs at the request of clients and what functions these sites and programs
                       should have. This is very important since the creation of user-friendly programs and compliance with the customer's 
                       requirements is the most important stage in the development. The Web Programming course will teach me to understand
                        modern languages, constructs used on the Web (such as HTML5, Advanced CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, JSON and PHP), 
                        how to design and correctly interact with a website with databases, and more. The Database Concepts course will 
                        teach me to understand and work with SQL-based databases. Databases are one of the essential aspects to be aware 
                        of when creating internet sites. Client-server communication is very widely used to retrieve data from a database 
                        using SQL. I will be able to complete these courses in May 2022 and think that 
                      I can find myself a job as a Web Developer and continue my education in Bachelor of Information Technology.
