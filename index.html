                                <li>My interest in IT started after I played a computer game for the first time. It was in 1987 when I was a teenager and computers were very rare. Since then, I began to wonder how computers are arranged, what can be done
                                    with them, and I decided that I would become an expert in this area. Later, when I learned a lot about computers, I became interested in the Internet, web development, and also training programs. I can confidently say
                                    that my interest in IT technologies began with the first computer game. Then colleges and universities began to open courses in computer science. I signed up for a software development course and devoted a lot of effort
                                    to my studies. Then I worked in technical support in an Internet company and this job also gave me a lot of knowledge.<br></li>
                                <li> My choice of RMIT was not accidental. I was looking for online training with a flexible schedule and in a reliable and good educational institution. And the RMIT program suited me for all my requests. Enrollment and pre-enrollment
                                    consultations were the most convenient and understandable. I was given very quick and comprehensive answers to questions about tuition, payment and so on.<br></li>
                                <li> I expect to get a Bachelor's degree in IT, and my expectations ah are the study of computer structures, computer networks, various user interfaces, databases and web development. In addition, I look forward to an in-depth
                                    study of the leading programming languages ​​such as Java, C++. Also, I expect that I will be given the opportunity to learn well the theoretical part for developing User Interfaces, negotiations with clients, presentations,
                                    successful teamwork in a group, and developing projects in a working team.

                            I would like to develop program which will help to get rid of gaming addiction in adults and children. Recently, children have been sitting at home and the main communication takes place through games and social networks. Sometimes it becomes addictive.
                            How can we distract the user from spending hours on games? After all, this time can be spent, for example, on studying history, biology or something else, depending on the age of the person. I thin about a program for microlearning
                            which will display the task window on top of the game or social network.. The program will automatically offer to go through a micro lesson on some topic and answer questions. Only 3-5 minutes. And only then will be possible
                            to open the game or social network or continue with it. Will be possible to customize the appearance of the window of this program and make training pauses in games and when using social networks. In addition, the microlearning
                            program will also be managed from the phone, if the parents want to see how the program is running on the child's computer.
